If such rules permit implied consent as a result of the failure of the retail forex customer to object after having received notice of the proposed assignment or transfer, such rules must provide that the notice must include a statement that the retail forex customer is not required to accept the proposed assignment or transfer and may direct the transferor firm to liquidate the positions of the retail forex customer or transfer the account to a firm of the retail forex customer's selection.\\n(3) For assignments and transfers made under this section, other than at the retail forex customer's request, the transferee retail foreign exchange dealer, futures commission merchant or introducing broker must provide to the retail forex customer the risk disclosure statements and forms of acknowledgment required by part 5 of this chapter and receive the required signed acknowledgments within sixty days of such assignments or transfers.

Each retail foreign exchange dealer, futures commission merchant or introducing broker shall file with the Commission prior notice of any transfer of accounts of any retail forex customer that is not initiated at the request of the customer, where the transfer involves 50 percent or more of the transferor's total number of retail forex customer accounts.\\n(c) Contents of notice to the Commission. The notice required by paragraph (b) of this section shall include:\\n(1) The name, principal business address and telephone number of the transferor futures retail foreign exchange dealer, futures commission merchant or introducing broker;\\n(2) The name, principal business address and telephone number of each transferee retail foreign exchange dealer, futures commission merchant or introducing broker;\\n(3) The designated self-regulatory organization for the transferor and transferee firms;\\n(4) A brief statement as to the reasons for the transfer;\\n(5) A copy of any notices to customers regarding the transfers; and\\n(6) A statement of the number of accounts to be transferred.\\n(d) Notice of the bulk liquidation of retail forex transactions. A retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant may not initiate the bulk liquidation of properly margined retail forex transactions unless such liquidation complies with the rules and procedures of the retail forex dealer's or futures commission merchant's designated self-regulatory organization and the retail forex dealer or futures commission merchant provides the Commission with prior written notice of the liquidation.\\n(e) Contents of notice of bulk liquidation. The notice required by paragraph (d) of this section shall include:\\n(1) The name, principal business address and telephone number of the initiating retail foreign exchange dealer or futures commission merchant;\\n(2) A brief statement of the reasons for the liquidation;\\n(3) A copy of any notices to customers regarding the liquidation; and\\n(4) A statement of the number of accounts to be liquidated.\\n(f) Filing of notices.

If a proposed transfer is not completed in accordance with the notice required to be filed by paragraph (b) of this section, a corrective notice shall be filed within five business days of the date such proposed transfer was to occur explaining why the proposed transfer was not completed.\\n[75 FR 55432, Sept. 10, 2010, as amended at 78 FR 22419, Apr. 16, 2013]\\n\",\n",
